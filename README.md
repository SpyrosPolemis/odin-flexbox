# odin-flexbox
Created as part of The Odin Project - Foundations curriculum. 

Given the following image and specifications, the task was to build the webpage from scratch.

Reflection: This project was really helpful in getting comfortable with flexbox. I definitely have a much better understanding of it now than before I started, however I'm not 100% comfortable, and I think my code in some sections such as the info section could be improved.
